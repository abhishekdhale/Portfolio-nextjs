# Task Tracking Rules

## Task Analysis
- Always analyze requirements before breaking down tasks
- Identify dependencies between tasks when creating breakdowns
- Estimate relative complexity of tasks (Simple/Medium/Complex)
- Consider testing requirements for each feature

## Progress Updates
- Proactively check task progress with each interaction
- Update task files without being explicitly asked
- Calculate accurate progress percentages based on completed checkboxes
- Commit to specific timestamps in progress updates

## Task File Management
- Follow the structured format for all task files
- Ensure task files reflect the current state of development
- Use consistent terminology across all task tracking
- Create subtasks for any task requiring multiple steps
