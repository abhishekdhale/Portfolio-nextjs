# Implementation Strategy

## Sequential Thinking
- Break down complex problems into discrete steps
- Always provide a clear plan before implementing code
- Use step-by-step reasoning for debugging and troubleshooting
- For complex features, create a mini-roadmap of implementation stages

## Evidence-Based Suggestions
- Base all recommendations on actual code in the project
- Avoid assumptions about project structure or dependencies
- Cite specific files or patterns when making suggestions
- Always verify compatibility with existing code
