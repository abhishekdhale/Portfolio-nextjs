# Documentation and Context

## Project Documentation
- All PRD documents in /docs directory should be treated as the source of truth
- Verify requirements against PRD before implementing any feature
- Reference appropriate documentation when suggesting solutions
- Prefer existing patterns found in the codebase over introducing new ones
- Always consult the project's PRD.md file at the project root for clear understanding of goals and features
- Review all additional documentation files within the docs directory provided with the project

## Documentation Updates
- If additional or updated documentation is required, use MCP servers (Brave Search, Puppeteer, FireCrawl) to locate official and current sources online
- Document all significant changes and decisions
- Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
- Add inline documentation for complex logic or non-obvious implementations

## Technical Context
- Always check the project structure before making assumptions
- Verify package.json for dependencies before suggesting new libraries
- Examine neighboring files to understand code organization and patterns
- Always check for existing implementations of similar functionality

## Technical Stack Compliance
- Adhere strictly to the project's established technology stack
- Do not introduce new technologies unless explicitly instructed and justified
- You may suggest alternative technologies if beneficial, but never implement them without user confirmation
- Verify compatibility with existing dependencies before suggesting updates
- Follow established patterns and conventions within the codebase

## Documentation Standards
- Use consistent formatting across all documentation files
- Include examples for complex features or configurations
- Maintain a clear hierarchy of information
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Document breaking changes and migrations clearly
